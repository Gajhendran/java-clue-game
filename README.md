First game that I wrote a few years ago.  
Recently ported the old code base to LIBGDX and fixed alot of bugs in the processing.
Also removed the older smartfox multiplayer mode.

Instructions:

After running "mvn install", extract the zip file in the target directory and execute the jar file with the java executor.  
Java runs the main class from the jar from the manifest, and game should start up.  
ie Double click on the jar and see if it runs automatically.
If running in the eclipse IDE, then run the ClueMain java class as the application.

Single Player Mode:  

Not much to say here.  Just pick the number of computer controlled players and your player and try it out.
